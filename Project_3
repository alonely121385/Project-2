Project_3 Plant moisture monitoring system with Email notification
This project adopted the Scrum Agile framework, utilizing iterative development cycles to build a "Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with Cloud Data Logging System." The development was structured into a 14-day sprint, with user stories guiding task prioritization and execution. Progress was tracked using burndown charts, and version control was managed through GitHub. The outcome was a fully functional system integrating hardware sensors with cloud-based data visualization, supported by comprehensive Agile documentation.
